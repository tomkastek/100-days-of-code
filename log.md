# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked in bloc [tutorial](https://felangel.github.io/bloc/#/fluttercountertutorial) until implementing first example.

**Thoughts** Easy to use in a first place. I know there is more complicated stuff but the tutorial is awesome. Also I want to learn to use the CupertinoAppBar correctly (or app bar in the bottom instead of top in general) and keep the floating button on the screen while animating between them (work for a long time later not the next days)
